The level is coming together now!

I think this is going to be the thumbnail. Obviously I'll update it with the level but I think the position and angle is perfect

I've been enjoying adding some new content to the level. My favourite so far is the breakable beer bottles.

It's the kinda moment I feel someone would say "Is that even possible in GoldSrc?" which really makes me proud.

I had to model these little guys ENTIRELY in J.A.C.K which was really tiring but the result was worth it. Take a look!

I also added a smashy plate to it. To be honest I really hate the fact that the lighting acts weird around the spike plate.

It allows the player to figure out that something is off by themselves. I'd rather have it blend into the hangover so nobody would suspect it.

What's the deal with the ladders. From different angles certain textures don't appear. Yeah something is weird. Maybe setting Render mode to Additive would help?

I think that style really works with the pool but with everything else it shouldn't be like that.

(I don't have a screenshot of this)






To conclude this post I thought I'd just say that I am so happy to see how far this level has come from just a slab in a skybox with a trigger_hurt at the bottom.

Even from the first little fence, the wall, and even the building not having an entrance, just a balcony, it has still come so far. I never thought that this basic bare metal Half-Life map would actually become something that I enjoyed playing.
